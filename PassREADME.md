ðŸ“œ How It Works
User Inputs:
>Asks for a 4-digit number.

>Asks for 4 alphabets.

>Asks for special characters only (like @, #, $, %, etc.)


Validation::
>Ensures exactly 4 digits for numbers.

>Ensures exactly 4 letters for alphabets.

>Special characters should not contain any letters or numbers.


Password Adjustments::
>If the entered alphabets are all lowercase, the last alphabet is automatically capitalized.


Password Length Check::
>Ensures the total password length is not more than 9 characters.

>If it exceeds, the process restarts automatically.


Output::
>Displays the password length.

>Displays the final password in the format:    <4-digit number><special characters><modified alphabets>
