Three prisoners A, B, and C are in jail. The governor will release one of them randomly, and the other two will be executed. Prisoner A asks the jailer to tell him the name of one of the other two prisoners (B or C) who will be executed.

The jailer says: "B will be executed."

A now reasons that either he or C will be released, so his chances have improved from 1/3 to 1/2.

But actually, this is not true. His probability of being released is still 1/3. The twist is that knowing B will be executed actually increases C's probability to 2/3, not A's.

Infact, A's probability becomes 1/6 becoz of coin toss.
